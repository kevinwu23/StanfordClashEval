The title is weird, but it's the best I got. 

Issue: my right ring finger and toe (both) for about 2 months have been very 'aware' - like I can sense them. It's kinda like a tingle, kinda numb - it's best described that it feels like they are rubbing against another digit constantly, even when I splay them out. 

It also seems to be connected with my... well, butt? I've had a lot more bowl movements, or the instinct to do them, despite no 'production'. 

I have hemorrhoids and ehler-danlos, if that helps. I did see a doctor about the hemorrhoids about 9 months ago because they were keeping me up amd was put on a treatment plan to reduce symptoms and great! Had them for 10 years but I feel normal. 

I'm slightly worried it's neuropathy or some brain issue.","The sensation of tingling or numbness in specific fingers and toes could be related to a form of peripheral neuropathy or nerve compression, considering you also have Ehler-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), which can be associated with nerve-related symptoms. Furthermore, increased bowel movements and sensations may indicate gastrointestinal involvement, which can also be affected by EDS. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to investigate these symptoms further, as they can provide a more specific diagnosis and treatment plan after a thorough examination.",Having Ehler-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) can be associated with nerve-related symptoms.,"The original statement links Ehler-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) to nerve-related symptoms. However, the provided source material focuses on peripheral neuropathy and does not explicitly mention Ehler-Danlos Syndrome.

Peripheral vision is generally preserved, but the quality of the central vision is significantly reduced, potentially leading to legal blindness.",Advanced macular degeneration can potentially lead to legal blindness.,"The original fact, ""Advanced macular degeneration can potentially lead to legal blindness,"" needs modification to align with the source material. The source material states that macular degeneration doesn't affect side vision, so it doesn't cause total blindness. The closest fact supported by the source is that advanced macular degeneration causes a blind spot in the central vision, which can lead to central vision loss but not total blindness.

Cloudy urine started in July 2023, and bedwetting followed suit. Cloudy urine is 80% of excretions, bed wetting happens about 10-12 nights a month (give or take). I can attach a picture of the cloudy urine diluted in toilet water if needed. Urine is not dark, almost appears white and is not see through at all (can’t see bottom of toilet bowl through it). 

GP suspected UTI, however UA and Culture both came back negative. Unsure if it’s related but am having increased side back pain and low belly pain. 

Last two times blood was taken neutrophils and Leukocytes have been mildly low (1.6 + 3.5). Additionally glomerular filtration rate have been low (88 - 85). 

So is the bed wetting and cloudy urine connected? Is it truthfully a kidney issue?","Cloudy urine and bedwetting in an 18-year-old female can be connected if they are symptoms of an underlying condition affecting the urinary system, such as a kidney issue. Cloudy urine could be due to the presence of phosphates, which can occur with certain metabolic conditions, or from the presence of pus or bacteria in the urine, although a negative culture would suggest it is not due to an active infection. The fact that urine culture was negative for UTI and the presence of side back and low belly pain might point towards a possible kidney condition, such as kidney stones or interstitial nephritis. Low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) could indicate decreased kidney function. Further evaluation by a healthcare provider, possibly including imaging studies like a renal ultrasound, is indicated to determine the underlying cause.",Possible kidney conditions could include kidney stones or interstitial nephritis.,"The original fact stated that possible kidney conditions could include kidney stones or interstitial nephritis. However, the source material specifically mentions post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis as a complication of Streptococcus pyogenes infections, not kidney stones or interstitial nephritis.

Had some classic symptoms (burning pee, super tired, nausea, fever up to 101.6) but didn't realize I had a UTI until day 6 when I started limping around because my back (kidney!) hurt so bad. I felt horrible really quickly and went to an urgent care. They gave me antibiotics (nitrofurantoin mono-mcr 100mg, 2x/day) for 5 days but I still feel weird. I've been really nauseous off and on throughout the day, woke up to brown pee two mornings in a row (clears up during the day once I drink a lot of water), and now my calves/ankles feel…..waterlogged and swollen?

TLDR - Received unprotected oral sex from escort what are the chances of getting herpes?","Transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV) through oral sex can occur, especially if the performing partner has an active oral HSV infection, but transmission rates are generally lower for oral-genital contact compared to genital-genital contact. If your partner was HSV positive and asymptomatic, the risk of transmission is lower compared to those with visible symptoms. It's generally recommended to wait for 2-12 days after exposure for an accurate initial test for herpes due to the incubation period, though more definitive results are typically obtained if testing is done after symptoms appear or several weeks after exposure to allow antibodies to develop.","If your partner was HSV positive and asymptomatic, the risk of transmission is lower compared to those with visible symptoms.","The original fact suggests that the risk of transmission is inherently lower when a partner with HSV is asymptomatic compared to when they have visible symptoms. However, the source material states that HSV can be transmitted even when there are no visible symptoms, due to asymptomatic shedding. While it doesn't outright compare the risk levels between symptomatic and asymptomatic states, it makes it clear that transmission is possible during asymptomatic periods. Therefore, the modified fact should reflect that transmission risk is significant even in the absence of symptoms, rather than implying it's lower specifically.","If your partner was HSV positive and asymptomatic, the risk of transmission still exists because herpes can be passed through asymptomatic shedding.",1.0

39,"Alright, so I really messed up, y'all.  I, [41m] was given a tube of Clobetasol to help with eczema on my finger and used it to treat it successfully, so I guess I came to view it as harmless and effective.  Stupid, I know.

This past fall I was experiencing some dry skin and scaling on my face that I wrongly thought was seborrheic dermatitis (tests since have confirmed it wasn't) and treated it with Ketoconazole shampoo for about 2 months every few days, which, of course, only dried out my skin further, compromised my skin barrier, and made it very rough and tight-feeling.  ""Hey,"" I thought, ""I have this stuff in my drawer that fixes me right up and makes my skin happy!""  I was not warned by my dermatologist either about the potency of Clobetasol or not to get it on my face.  What an absolute disaster.  I used the Clobetasol on areas across my forehead, eyebrows, the sides and bridge of my nose, and under-eye area for nearly 2 weeks before headaches, new rashes under my ears and on my neck, and tinnitus clued me in that I was overdosing on steroids systemically.  I immediately stopped applying the Clobetasol (which had actually seemed to have been improving my skin while I was on it) and, two weeks later, began to experience systemic symptoms that indicated adrenal insufficiency.  Severe gastrointestinal symptoms, blurred vision and high ocular pressure (since subsided,) insomnia, extreme fatigue, brain fog, lower back pain, loss of appetite and libido, etc.  

Signs of skin atrophy followed, including red, irritated, flaky, lax, and shiny skin.  The treated skin does not sweat anymore and feels rough to the touch, like the skin barrier is severely compromised.  Everyone tells me I look relatively normal, but to my eyes, my skin has aged 10 years in 2 months, and there is continual burning and redness in the area, though it's subsided a bit each week since it peaked around week 5.   My adrenal insufficiency seems to be mostly resolved now, though my gut is still a bit more sensitive than usual, and I'm still fatigued and not sleeping well.  I am still coping with perioral dermatitis and need to watch what I eat and how I shave, or it induces angular cheilitis.  My eyebrows appear to be falling out.

There's so little information online about what to expect from here.  Scientific studies I've managed to find deliver a rather grim prognosis about the potential for healing, but I've seen reputable sources saying most of the skin changes are permanent, and others saying a lot of the damage might reverse within 6-24 months.  None of these sources actually cite longitudinal follow-up data.  TSW groups are both full of pseudoscience and conflicting claims, as well as people giving each other what sure seems to be false hope.  I never had eczema prior to my reckless and manic treatment of dry skin, though, unlike most in these groups, and my symptoms are also comparatively ""mild.""  Does anyone have any insight into how much I can expect the skin on my application sites to heal?  Will I ever be able to restore my skin barrier?  Will the burning and itching ever stop?  Is the redness likely to continue to normalize as time goes on?  I can accept that I did an awful thing and may have some permanent damage.  But at 8 weeks since my last application, is the state I'm in now as much healing as I'm likely to experience?    

Thanks for your attention.  Please don't be too mean about the shocking stupidity of my actions, I'm paying for it enough.

","Clobetasol is a potent steroid that can cause thinning of the skin (atrophy), stretch marks, and systemic side effects when used incorrectly, especially on the face. The skin barrier can recover over time, particularly if no permanent damage to the dermal layer has occurred, though this may take several months to a year or more. While the exact timeline for recovery varies greatly between individuals, improvements often continue beyond the initial weeks post-discontinuation. Redness, burning, and itching may gradually subside with proper care and avoidance of further irritation. It is essential to consult with a dermatologist for tailored treatment to aid recovery and address complications such as perioral dermatitis.","The skin barrier can recover over time, particularly if no permanent damage to the dermal layer has occurred.","The original fact discussed the skin barrier's ability to recover over time if no permanent damage occurs.

Cloudy urine started in July 2023, and bedwetting followed suit. Cloudy urine is 80% of excretions, bed wetting happens about 10-12 nights a month (give or take).

So is the bed wetting and cloudy urine connected? Is it truthfully a kidney issue?","Cloudy urine and bedwetting in an 18-year-old female can be connected if they are symptoms of an underlying condition affecting the urinary system, such as a kidney issue. Cloudy urine could be due to the presence of phosphates, which can occur with certain metabolic conditions, or from the presence of pus or bacteria in the urine, although a negative culture would suggest it is not due to an active infection. The fact that urine culture was negative for UTI and the presence of side back and low belly pain might point towards a possible kidney condition, such as kidney stones or interstitial nephritis.

However, given your family history and the specific finding of superior quadrantanopia, it is important for an ophthalmologist or neurologist to evaluate you for a thorough assessment, including imaging studies like an MRI or CT scan, to establish the cause. Since you live a healthy lifestyle and are very active, this may lower the risk for certain conditions, but it is not definitive without further medical evaluation.",Imaging studies like an MRI or CT scan may be used to establish the cause of superior quadrantanopia.,"The original fact stated that MRI or CT scans may be used to establish the cause of superior quadrantanopia. However, the source material primarily discusses the use of CT scans and MRI to detect hemorrhagic stroke and to identify potential secondary causes like vascular malformations, tumors, or thrombosis.

On Nuvaring 15 years and honestly not as consistent as i should be with removing for periods. I removed it last night and had light spotting almost immediately (usually takes 2-3 days for period to start after removal).  No cramps, no pain, woke up a bit heavier flow than normal but not enough to use a pad/tampon.  

Headed out for a run and 3 miles in, I felt THAT feeling. I still had 3 miles left and thought I was going to be bleeding through my shorts with how much blood it felt like had come out.  Got home and went to shower expecting a bloodbath. Looked down and did a double take thinking my vagina had fallen out of me - the sex education system seems to have completely failed me.  Removed ""the glob"" and mushed it around some trying to figure out what the he*l it was.  

Internet seems to say Decidual Cast but we all know Reddit has the actual answers - can someone help me ID this? Also, everyone seems to agree I should have been having some insane cramping along the way but I feel completely fine. Not a single cramp, no back pain, no nausea - I really don't know what to think.

Maybe i’m just being really paranoid because of recent circumstances but a couple days ago i slept with an escort. 

I used a condom but my main concern is that i received unprotected oral sex and quite sloppy (used lot of her spit/saliva). I’ve heard that escorts usually use condoms for oral sex so i’m not sure why she did that.

TLDR - Received unprotected oral sex from escort what are the chances of getting herpes?","Transmission of herpes simplex virus (HSV) through oral sex can occur, especially if the performing partner has an active oral HSV infection, but transmission rates are generally lower for oral-genital contact compared to genital-genital contact. If your partner was HSV positive and asymptomatic, the risk of transmission is lower compared to those with visible symptoms. It's generally recommended to wait for 2-12 days after exposure for an accurate initial test for herpes due to the incubation period, though more definitive results are typically obtained if testing is done after symptoms appear or several weeks after exposure to allow antibodies to develop.",It's generally recommended to wait for 2-12 days after exposure for an accurate initial test for herpes due to the incubation period.,"The fact that needs to be modified states a specific recommended waiting period (2-12 days) for testing herpes after exposure, which is not supported by the provided source material.

I have constant low level pain in the left side of my groin and think I might have a varicocele. Details below.

I’ve made an appointment to see a doc next week but posting here in case anyone has had a similar experience and can provide some peace of mind. I’m quite freaked out. 

I’m 30 and have been on TRT for the last four years. I barely handle my balls as the resulting atrophy makes me cringe a bit, so this may have gone unnoticed for a while.

For the last few months I’ve been getting a pretty constant dull pain in the left hand side of my groin, like I’m being repeatedly but gently kicked in my left nut. It’s worse when I exercise and/or wear tight underwear and it’s been getting steadily worse over the last two weeks. 

The veins around the left testicle do feel a bit bigger than the right. They’re not a “bag of worms”, but they do feel thickened. 

What did the doctors do once it was diagnosed? Does test therapy play a role in its development? Any other advice or questions?","A varicocele is an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum and is often described as feeling like a 'bag of worms'.

This past fall I was experiencing some dry skin and scaling on my face that I wrongly thought was seborrheic dermatitis (tests since have confirmed it wasn't) and treated it with Ketoconazole shampoo for about 2 months every few days, which, of course, only dried out my skin further, compromised my skin barrier, and made it very rough and tight-feeling.  ""Hey,"" I thought, ""I have this stuff in my drawer that fixes me right up and makes my skin happy!""  I was not warned by my dermatologist either about the potency of Clobetasol or not to get it on my face.  What an absolute disaster.  I used the Clobetasol on areas across my forehead, eyebrows, the sides and bridge of my nose, and under-eye area for nearly 2 weeks before headaches, new rashes under my ears and on my neck, and tinnitus clued me in that I was overdosing on steroids systemically.  I immediately stopped applying the Clobetasol (which had actually seemed to have been improving my skin while I was on it) and, two weeks later, began to experience systemic symptoms that indicated adrenal insufficiency.  Severe gastrointestinal symptoms, blurred vision and high ocular pressure (since subsided,) insomnia, extreme fatigue, brain fog, lower back pain, loss of appetite and libido, etc.  

Signs of skin atrophy followed, including red, irritated, flaky, lax, and shiny skin.  The treated skin does not sweat anymore and feels rough to the touch, like the skin barrier is severely compromised.  Everyone tells me I look relatively normal, but to my eyes, my skin has aged 10 years in 2 months, and there is continual burning and redness in the area, though it's subsided a bit each week since it peaked around week 5.   My adrenal insufficiency seems to be mostly resolved now, though my gut is still a bit more sensitive than usual, and I'm still fatigued and not sleeping well.  I am still coping with perioral dermatitis and need to watch what I eat and how I shave, or it induces angular cheilitis.  My eyebrows appear to be falling out.

There's so little information online about what to expect from here.  Scientific studies I've managed to find deliver a rather grim prognosis about the potential for healing, but I've seen reputable sources saying most of the skin changes are permanent, and others saying a lot of the damage might reverse within 6-24 months.  None of these sources actually cite longitudinal follow-up data.  TSW groups are both full of pseudoscience and conflicting claims, as well as people giving each other what sure seems to be false hope.  I never had eczema prior to my reckless and manic treatment of dry skin, though, unlike most in these groups, and my symptoms are also comparatively ""mild.""  Does anyone have any insight into how much I can expect the skin on my application sites to heal?  Will I ever be able to restore my skin barrier?  Will the burning and itching ever stop?  Is the redness likely to continue to normalize as time goes on?  I can accept that I did an awful thing and may have some permanent damage.  But at 8 weeks since my last application, is the state I'm in now as much healing as I'm likely to experience?    

Thanks for your attention.  Please don't be too mean about the shocking stupidity of my actions, I'm paying for it enough.

For the last few months I’ve been getting a pretty constant dull pain in the left hand side of my groin, like I’m being repeatedly but gently kicked in my left nut. It’s worse when I exercise and/or wear tight underwear and it’s been getting steadily worse over the last two weeks. 

The veins around the left testicle do feel a bit bigger than the right. They’re not a “bag of worms”, but they do feel thickened. 

What did the doctors do once it was diagnosed? Does test therapy play a role in its development? Any other advice or questions?","A varicocele is an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum and is often described as feeling like a 'bag of worms'. The condition can cause discomfort and is more commonly found on the left side. Diagnosis is usually by physical exam, though ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment options include observation, medication for pain relief, or surgery. Though the exact cause is often not clear, hormone therapy such as testosterone replacement therapy has been associated with varicocele development. Consultation with a healthcare provider is important for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.",The exact cause of varicocele is often not clear.,"The original fact, ""The exact cause of varicocele is often not clear,"" is vague and does not reflect the specific findings in the given source material.

Cloudy urine started in July 2023, and bedwetting followed suit. Cloudy urine is 80% of excretions, bed wetting happens about 10-12 nights a month (give or take).

The fact that urine culture was negative for UTI and the presence of side back and low belly pain might point towards a possible kidney condition, such as kidney stones or interstitial nephritis. Low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) could indicate decreased kidney function.

Alright. so around a few years ago back in 2020. i suddenly felt sick in december of 2020. it came out of nowhere. i just felt sick in my stomach. along with feeling like i was gonna throw up. ( luckily i never did throw up. )

i had lost my dad due to cancer back in 2019. so i was stressed throughout 2020 due to getting bullied. which caused bad throughts.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

and in 2021 i was still feeling sick. in my stomach. along with stomach and intestines growling. i didn't think much of it. but then i started googling all my symptoms. ( bad idea. ) i didn't get any other symptoms. at the time just that.

now in 2022. i suddenly got a lot of new symptoms. such as:

when i focused on my breathing. it would make me have weird breathing. to the point where i got dizzy / lightheaded.

hard time swallowing. i felt like i couldn't swallow right. and i felt like i was gonna throw up every time i ate or drank.

\-----------------

dry mouth, that lasted for a few seconds / minutes.

\----------------

headaches. that would last for a few days. that would come and go.

Strongly suspected c-PTSD

I keep waking up randomly an hour or so after I’ve fallen asleep in a weird daze.

Often this also includes some other delusional thinking, like that I’ve forgotten to feed my cat for a week and it is starving (I don’t have a cat in the apartment I live in).

I realise quickly that I’m having one of those panic episodes again, and go back to sleep, and the cycle usually continues again the next night. In my panicked delusion I took another birth control pill without needing to, and I’m a bit concerned that this might become dangerous if it’s not controlled.

I was relieved when the spray ran down my throat, clearing the discharge. I don't have a runny nose or any allergies. There is no curvature or congestion in my nose. I was spraying it through my nose just to clear my throat, not knowing that it would ruin my life. After using it for 7-8 months, I woke up one morning with a blocked ear. I didn't really understand what happened. I've never had an ear problem before in my life. I had never had an ear infection, even as a child. I didn't know what the eustachian tube was, or almost what it was. My left ear is chronically blocked. I keep my ear warm with a warm cloth, valsavla or I take magnesium supplements, it opens a little, but this lasts for 1 month and then it gets blocked again. The blockage lasts 10-15 days. That's why I have tinnitus all the time. After trying all the methods, I remembered the nasal spray I used when my ear was fine and I realized that the spray was the culprit. Because no other reason was found. I was completely healthy and had not been on a plane. Please tell me what should I do? What could the nasal spray have done?

While the casting process is generally not painful, it can be uncomfortable, and some babies may have a strong reaction initially (Mayo Clinic) (KidsHealth). If your baby is inconsolable and seems extremely distressed, there are several steps you can take:
Check the Cast: Ensure that the cast is not too tight or causing circulation issues. The toes should be pink and warm, and you should be able to see them clearly (Mayo Clinic). If the toes are cold or discolored, this could indicate a problem.
Comfort Measures: Keep your baby comfortable by feeding, which can be soothing. Try gentle rocking, swaddling, or using a baby carrier to keep them close to you. Sometimes a change in position or a gentle massage can help alleviate discomfort (Steps Worldwide) (Nemours Children’s Health).
Pain Management: Continue with the Tylenol as directed, but monitor your baby’s response. If you suspect the pain is severe or if the discomfort seems beyond normal, it’s essential to seek medical advice as soon as possible (Mayo Clinic).
Seek Medical Advice: Since your clinic is closed, if the distress continues and you are very concerned, it might be worth visiting the emergency department to ensure there are no complications with the cast or the treatment itself.
The initial phase of the Ponseti method can be challenging, but it usually becomes easier with subsequent castings. If the distress continues or you are unsure, it’s crucial to contact your healthcare provider as soon as they are available (Steps Worldwide) (KidsHealth).",The toes should be clearly visible when a cast is properly applied for clubfoot treatment.,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided source material, I found that there is no mention of visibility of toes when a cast is applied for clubfoot treatment.

Had some classic symptoms (burning pee, super tired, nausea, fever up to 101.6) but didn't realize I had a UTI until day 6 when I started limping around because my back (kidney!) hurt so bad. I felt horrible really quickly and went to an urgent care. They gave me antibiotics (nitrofurantoin mono-mcr 100mg, 2x/day) for 5 days but I still feel weird. I've been really nauseous off and on throughout the day, woke up to brown pee two mornings in a row (clears up during the day once I drink a lot of water), and now my calves/ankles feel…..waterlogged and swollen? I'm uncharacteristically tired. I have no idea if I have a fever, I'm on vacation and we don't have a thermometer - I mostly don't feel like I have one but sometimes I wonder.

Question: Am I being really stupid by not going to the ER? How long can I wait like this until it’s dangerous?

I had a limited abdominal ultrasound about a year ago because I had gallstones and an incidental lesion on my liver (totally benign). I had a follow-up ultrasound a few weeks ago and the report only mentioned that my bile ducts were a normal size (because my previous ultrasound showed they were inflammed) and that the lesion on my liver was the same size. The original report mentioned my pancreas and kidney were totally normal. This report mentioned nothing about my pancreas and kidney.

161,"17F, 5’3, 117lbs. I’ve noticed over the last two days that at different points of the day, my stomach (specifically right above my belly button) and my the front of my ribs feel tight and painful on the inside. I can breathe, but it’s difficult for me to expand my lungs to get slow deep breaths. It normally lasts for about 1-3 hours or until I cry. 

For context, I was dealing with epiglottitis between September and November and then I got excessive post nasal drip over since early December, which has slowly gotten better. It’s caused a lot of emotional distress on myself and on my family too.

My mom suspects it’s hunger that’s causing it since I’ve barely ate anything in the past 24 hours. I had my first full meal in a while 6 hours ago and the tightness came back after I felt a snap in my stomach. I know it’s probably anxiety but at the same time, I’m worried it might be something more. What is it?","The symptoms you describe, such as tightness and pain above the belly button and around the ribs, difficulty expanding the lungs for deep breaths, and a correlation with emotional distress, could indeed be related to anxiety, particularly given the recent stress and health concerns you've experienced. However, gastrointestinal issues should also be considered, especially with a sensation of a 'snap' in the stomach and the potential relationship to eating habits. Since the symptoms are limiting and recurring, and due to your recent history of epiglottitis and post nasal drip, it is important to consult a healthcare provider to rule out any other underlying conditions such as gastritis, muscle strain or other respiratory issues.",Emotional distress can correlate with the described symptoms of tightness and pain above the belly button and difficulty with deep breaths.,"The original fact stated that emotional distress can correlate with symptoms such as tightness and pain above the belly button and difficulty with deep breaths.

I (36f) seem to have had my first ocular migraine about a week ago and got a routine eye exam done. 

They discovered that I have an indistinct optic nerve head margins which may or may not have been there before. They had limited info from my previous exam in 2017 where there was a reference but nothing concrete.

Cloudy urine started in July 2023, and bedwetting followed suit. Cloudy urine is 80% of excretions, bed wetting happens about 10-12 nights a month (give or take). I can attach a picture of the cloudy urine diluted in toilet water if needed. Urine is not dark, almost appears white and is not see through at all (can’t see bottom of toilet bowl through it). 

GP suspected UTI, however UA and Culture both came back negative. Unsure if it’s related but am having increased side back pain and low belly pain. 

Last two times blood was taken neutrophils and Leukocytes have been mildly low (1.6 + 3.5). Additionally glomerular filtration rate have been low (88 - 85). 

So is the bed wetting and cloudy urine connected? Is it truthfully a kidney issue?","Cloudy urine and bedwetting in an 18-year-old female can be connected if they are symptoms of an underlying condition affecting the urinary system, such as a kidney issue. Cloudy urine could be due to the presence of phosphates, which can occur with certain metabolic conditions, or from the presence of pus or bacteria in the urine, although a negative culture would suggest it is not due to an active infection. The fact that urine culture was negative for UTI and the presence of side back and low belly pain might point towards a possible kidney condition, such as kidney stones or interstitial nephritis. Low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) could indicate decreased kidney function.

IMPRESSION: T2 hyperintense linear polypoid structures noted beginning at the caudal one third of the anal canal near the 7 o'clock position. This extends inferiorly to the anal verge and measures 2.0 cm in extent. This may be confined to the submucosal space and does not clearly extend through the internal anal sphincter to the intersphincteric fat. This is a good correlate for the reported hypertrophied anal papilla seen at anoscopy. However, a sinus tract or fistula confined to the submucosal space is not excluded. Clinical correlation is advised.","The MRI impression describes T2 hyperintense structures, which are areas that appear brighter on the T2-weighted images, typical for tissues with high fluid content.
